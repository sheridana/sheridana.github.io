**About**. I am a machine learning scientist interested in developing novel
approaches for processing large n-dimensional microscopy data. I am currently
working on brain circuit mapping at [E11 Bio](https://e11.bio).

**Research**. I am broadly interested in topics related to:
* Connectomics (and the brain in general)
* Machine learning for biological science
* Processing and understanding big data
* Scalable, accurate, and accessible solutions to challenging image
  processing tasks
* Interactive and intuitive visualizations

**Previous**. Prior to E11, I worked at the [Salk
Institute](https://www.salk.edu/) in the [Manor](https://manorlab.ucsd.edu) (now
at UCSD) and [Pereira](https://talmolab.org) labs on various projects related to
segmentation, super-resolution and multi-object tracking. Before that I was at
[HHMI Janelia](https://www.janelia.org/) in the
[Funke](https://funkelab.github.io) lab working on large scale neuron
segmentation. I studied neuroscience at [Knox College](https://www.knox.edu).
